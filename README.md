This project is relatively limited in scope so don't really read too deep into anything.
While I've proggrammed in C++ before, I wanted to take away all the higher level abstractions so I could 
become more independent of external libraries and really understand the C language including 
memory management.

This project aims to be a collection of sorting alogorithms that can be used conveniently at will
